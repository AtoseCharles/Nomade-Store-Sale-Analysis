RECOMMENDATION:

1. From the observation from the analysis of 2014 data, i recommend we do the following:
we could ask Nancy how she was able to do her work and why did she drop of by Feb and what was the step she did to change her standing. 
2, we could ask Nancy to have John katos has her assistance for a while so he could learn of her.
we can also use Nancy's template for the rest of the organization.

3. we can call and ask John Katos why he had a low return and ask him what he did differently in the month of June and what he did in July and take note.
4. Beer was our lowest performing sale, so we could either do a promo offer to make customers want it by either dropping the price for a while or buying a certain amount and getting an extra.
Then we should increase the sale distribution to other companies to sell it.

5. Coffee is our best-selling product and we had the most sales from the north, so we don't try to implement the same steps we use in the north and also do a discount sale for a while to improve sales.

6. Our worst sale of the year is Feb, so we can do discount sales every Feb so people would use that advantage to buy more thinking they are buying for free, and during Dec our largest month, we could increase the price a bit due to it festive season. 

7. we could also have Francis in areas of low sales and make them run on the same standards as us, that would cut the cost of transporting products to those locations
